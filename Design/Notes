Notes

1) Don't add private/hidden sass partials - jekyll compiles only specific hidden ones
    - The main.scss is the compiled css that comes out of _sass

2) Don't forget to link JS in the correct locations (after elements that already exist - if need be)

3) Adding a page is as simple as adding a new file to the root dir, and giving it a bit of YAML

IDEAS

- Add icons to the navbar
- Weekly Interpolation
    - Interject a bit of me discussing the song into a song
- Album of the Month
- Embedded player? Spotify? Soundcloud?
- Comments (Disqus)
- Ratings
    - Meter, or stars?

- Have a top five list
    - Display a quote from one of the songs in the header?
