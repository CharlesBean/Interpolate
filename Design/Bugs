---------------------------


TO FIX:


- After hovering over a nav option, hovering over the button/menu itself no longer works
- Find fonts
- Right click closes the nav
- Opening dev-tools window conflicts with album image
- Chrome compatability
    - Cant tab select navigation options
        - fixing the tab issue creates a new bug - see below
    - Other bug is the whole cn-wrapper is colored and moved on nav
- Clicking a nav link shows the green part underneath [FIXED]
- Nav word can be shaken left to right, etc.


+ Calculate angles of navigation links based on the number of pages, JS
    + Then add 2, etc., for space
+ Clean up variables in main.scss (& add some/refactor)
+ Responsiveness of header
